# Two-Level Cipher Algorithm

## Overview
This is a simple demonstration of a two-level encryption algorithm. This project combines a traditional substitution cipher with a binary tree traversal method to add an extra layer of security. The first encryption level uses a substitution cipher, while the second leverages a binary tree structure to obscure the data further.

**Two-Level Encryption:**  
- *Substitution Cipher:* The first level replaces characters based on a predefined scheme.  
- *Binary Tree Traversal:* The second level uses binary tree structures to further scramble the encrypted data.


## Project Structure
- **main.cpp:** Entry point for the application.
- **Cipher.cpp / Cipher.h:** Implementation of the substitution cipher used for the first encryption level.
- **BinaryTree.cpp / BinaryTree.h:** Implementation of the binary tree data structure used in the second encryption level.
- **execute.cmd:** Script to run the project on Windows.
